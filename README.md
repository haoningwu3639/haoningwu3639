## Self-Intro 

- 🧑‍💻 I am Haoning Wu.
- 🌱 I am currently a 4th-year PhD candidate at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://sjtu.edu.cn/), fortunately advised by [Prof. Weidi Xie](https://weidixie.github.io/index.html) and [Prof. Ya Zhang](https://annzhanglion.github.io/). Before that, I received my B.S. degree in EE (**IEEE Pilot Class**) also from [SJTU](https://sjtu.edu.cn/) in June 2022.
- 💬 I'm generally interested in **multi-modal learning**, especially **generative models**, **spatial intelligence**, and AI4Sports. My ultimate goal is to build an artificial general intelligence (AGI) that surpasses humans in **perception**, **thinking**, and **practical** abilities.
- 📧 **I am always eager to communicate and cooperate, so feel free to contact me!!!**
- 🙋 By the way, I am currently open to **research internship** opportunities related to **multi-modal generation and understanding**. Feel free to connect via email or WeChat.
